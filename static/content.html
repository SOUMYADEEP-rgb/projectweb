    <div class="Sun sun">
        <br>Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gases at the center of our solar system. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion to produce energy. This energy provides light and heat, essential for life on Earth. The Sun's gravity keeps all planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit.
